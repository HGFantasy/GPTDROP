## Part B — Duet Templates (from 16_Duet_Templates)

Version: v1.0 (2025-08-08)

Goal: Reliable duet structures with clear call/response, shared pre, and unified chorus. Keep hooks ≤9 syllables/line.

## Patterns (unisex; adapt pronouns)
**A. Mirror Verse → Shared Pre → Unified Chorus**  
- Verse: A (4 lines) / B (4 lines)  
- Pre: A+B alternating halves (8)  
- Chorus: A+B sing together (16)

**B. Ping-Pong Lines → Stack in Chorus**  
- Verse: A/B alternate every line (8)  
- Pre: A (4) then B (4)  
- Chorus: A+B unison, add harmony on 2nd half

**C. Call (A) → Echo (B) → Answer (Both)**  
- Verse: A leads (4), B echoes (4)  
- Pre: Both (8)  
- Chorus: Both; B takes high harmony

## Chorus shapes (≤9 syllables)
- **Two become one** / **Back to you**  
- **Keep me close** / **Close to you**  
- **Say the word** / **I’ll stay**

## Per-genre duet notes
- **Dance-Pop:** double the tag on the 2nd chorus with both voices; keep post-chorus vocal chop single-voice.  
- **Melodic EDM:** split the Pre into 4+4 lines with rising harmony; unison chorus first half, thirds on second half.  
- **Liquid DnB:** softer exchanges; 4-line chorus where A sings line 1/3, B sings 2/4.  
- **Synthwave:** baritone A + airy B; stack octaves in chorus; gated ad-libs only.  
- **Acoustic pop:** minimal doubles; tight phrasing; no chops.  
- **Pop-punk:** gang tag on final chorus; A/B trade bars in bridge.

## Example mini-chorus (unified)
**Back to you, back to you**  
**Every beat pulls me through**  
**Back to you, back to you**  
**I keep running back to you**
