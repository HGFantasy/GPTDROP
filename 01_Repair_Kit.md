# 01_Repair_Kit — Suno Songmaker Pro
Version: v1.0 (2025-08-08)

## Common Suno Misses → Exact Fixes

### 1) Muddy bass / 808-ish boom / stereo sub
- Add to **Style** (first line): mono sub 40–80 Hz; no 808s; HPF non-bass @100 Hz; tame 200–300 Hz.
- Keep kick fundamental clear; avoid boosts at 120–200 Hz.

### 2) Wrong drop shape (future-bass/big-room instead of target)
- Add: Drop: first 8 bars kick+bass only → then add lead + chords.
- Hardstyle: specify reverse-bass pattern or RAW kick (tok + saturated tail).

### 3) Talky/spoken vocals
- Add: ALL LINES SUNG; no spoken word/rap/whisper; countdown is pitched.
- In lyrics, hyphenate held vowels (e.g., be-cooome).

### 4) BPM drift / halftime feel
- Add: straight 4/4; no halftime; BPM = <value>.
- For hardstyle, try 155–157 BPM.

### 5) Random modulation / chord wander
- Add: Key: <key>, no modulation.

### 6) Bar-length chaos
- Force **Arrangement** with explicit bar counts for each section.

### 7) Syllable stuffing / bad stress
- Chorus lines ≤8–9 syllables; prefer open-vowel endings; repeat the hook.

### 8) Generic lead / harsh hats
- Lead: bright supersaws (EDM) / metallic screech (HS), short plate reverb, pitch rides, OTT.
- Top end: de-harsh hats; leave ~1 dB headroom; no pumping below 80 Hz.

### 9) Abrupt ending
- Add [2-bar tail] and long reverb decay; no early cutoff.

### 10) Wrong voice/register
- Specify female airy belt or male tenor/baritone (repeat once).

## Retry Playbook (apply in order)
1) Compress Style to ≤6 lines; lead with low-end line.
2) Lock or nudge BPM (e.g., 140→142, 155→157); keep straight 4/4; no halftime.
3) Neighbor key if harmony wanders (A min↔C maj; G min↔Bb maj).
4) Simplify chorus to ≤6 syllables/line; repeat hook 3×; open vowels.
5) Drop control: restate first 8 bars drop = kick+bass only.
6) If still off, pivot to a Strength genre with the same theme (see 00_Core_Macros).

## Strengths vs Struggles (for quick pivots)
- Excels: Electropop/Dance-Pop, Melodic EDM, Liquid DnB, Synthwave, Lofi/Chillhop, Acoustic pop, Pop-punk, Cinematic.
- Struggles: Hardstyle/RAW, Dubstep/Riddim, Psytrance, modern Techno (only do on request; use strict cues).

## Additional Mix Fixes

### Stereo & Width
- Keep sub **mono**; widen pads/leads **above 150 Hz** only.  
- If center feels empty, add **short stereo delay** to pads (not to sub/kick).

### Vocal Presence
- If vocals sink, reduce sidechain on vox; mention “**sidechain instruments, not vocals**” in Style.  
- Add **tight double** on choruses; keep sibilance soft.

### Reverb/Space
- If wash-y: shorten reverb pre-delay and decay; call “**de-harsh hats; leave ~1 dB headroom**” in Style.  
- Avoid long tails under dense drops; reserve long decay for the **[2-bar tail]**.
